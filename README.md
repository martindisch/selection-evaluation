# selection-evaluation
## Description
A simple application prototype to measure how fast users are at selecting
applications from a list, depending on whether it's a large list with all
elements or a smaller list with the most common elements and an overflow
for the rest.

## Usage
On a system with at least GTK 3.0 and Python 3, run it with `python eval.py`.
